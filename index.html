            <h2 class="heading">Who am I?</h2>
            <div>
                 <p>I am a 18-year-old college student from Batangas City, Batangas. Born on December 20, 2005 and currently studying Information Technology at Batangas State University - Alangilan Campus. A student that never backs down down from challenges and with a passion of exploring new ideas and expanding my knowledge in the Information Technology world.
                <br> 
                <br>
                I came from a family that just gets by everyday. Our necessities to live is provided thankfully due to my parents hardwork. My mother is a Team Leader at the company she works from, on the otherhand, my father is an Electrician OFW currently staying at Abu Dhabi. I am the eldest of my sibling, and I currently have one sister and she is one of my inspirations to continue working hard because she is a PWD. Working hard so I can achieve what we need is a way of me to help her despite her situation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Beyond college, I indulge myself with my hobbies which are going to the gym, playing basketball and video games, temporarily working from home, and constantly studying hard as I can. For now, I'm on an adventure to expand my knowledge in the Technology field and improve my skills in programming.
